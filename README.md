✅ TASK 3: Task Automation with Python Scripts

🎯 Objective

Create a Python script that automates a small, real-world repetitive task. The goal is to build something simple yet impactful using basic scripting and automation techniques.

💡 Suggested Ideas (Pick One):

1. 📁 Move Image Files**
   Automatically move all `.jpg` image files from one folder to another — great for organizing downloads or camera uploads.

2. 📄 Extract Email Addresses**
   Read through a `.txt` file, extract all valid email addresses using regular expressions, and save them to a new file for further use.

3. 🌐 Scrape Webpage Title**
   Access a fixed URL, extract the `<title>` of the webpage using web scraping, and save it to a file — useful for monitoring or logging.
